"""Guard against version drift between pyproject.toml and __init__.py.

Regression coverage for a real released bug found in reboot-safety-check:
pyproject.toml's [project] version was bumped for a release, but
__init__.py's __version__ (what `--version` actually prints, and what
get_version()-style user-facing checks read) was left stale. The wheel's
package metadata correctly said the new version while the CLI's own
`--version` output lied and said the old one -- caught only by an
independent post-release smoke test against the real published artifact.
This test makes that drift fail CI immediately next time, instead of
depending on someone remembering to re-verify by hand. Ported verbatim
(module-name-substituted) to close the same gap fleet-wide.

Deliberately avoids tomllib/tomli (tomllib is 3.11+ only, and some CI
matrices in this fleet still test py3.9/3.10) by parsing the single
`version = "..."` line under [project] with a plain regex -- no extra
dependency needed for a one-line, well-known-format field.
